# Computer-Seekho
The "Computer Seekho" project involves creating a web-based application for VITA (Vidyanidhi Info Tech Academy) to showcase its courses, catering to ages 3+ to senior citizens, from MSCIT to PG DAC. It also includes a gallery for kids' projects and ensures the system is database-driven for seamless and maintenance-free operation.
